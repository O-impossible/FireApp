# NUS Sports Update
Team: O(Impossible) 

Team Members: Yash Chowdhary and Sashankh Chengavalli Kumar
## Project Overview 

Level of Achievement: Gemini

Type of Application: Android Mobile App

Aim: To use an android application and firebase backend to develop a self explanatory user interface to perform the aforementioned operations, along with login authentication to separate the users. We hope this will provide all NUS students with up-to-date information on all sports events taking place on campus and ease the organisation process of such sports events.

Scope: This app aims to offer a one stop platform for organizing and following campus sports events. At the present stage of development, this app enables most of the important processes related to the tournament. It allows users to sign up and indicate interest, and apply by sending requests to participate in various sports events. For the members of the organizing committee (OC), the app allows them to view all requests, and approve/deny requests for participants/organizing committee spots.

Before Splashdown, we expect to extend the scope of the project to include a leader-board to maintain high scores for various sporting events during the tournament. We also expect to add notifications for chat messages, and for changes in status of requests. 

For this milestone, a chat-room has been made available for the organizers to communicate with each other on a regular basis, before or during the tournament.  

Motivation: The main source of motivation behind this project is the lack of real time organized information regarding sports events on campus – fixtures, timings, and (most importantly) results, unless you know somebody on the team or unless you yourself are a part of the team. This also seeks to eliminate the use of Google forms and other unofficial means of signing up and indication of interest, that may be easily missed by a significant number of students. This application seeks to take care of these problems and mainly caters to the needs of NUS students. The user-friendliness of the app makes the job of the organizers simpler by providing organized access to all information. Live-scores and fixtures will help engage more students in the sports events around campus, and improve the reach of these events.
